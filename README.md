# Fast computation of the exact permutation test

Small repo with code for experimenting with fast computation of the
exact permutation test.

To get a gist of what's going on look at the
[RStudio compiled notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hoehleatsu/permtest/blob/master/perm.html)
of the R-script perm.R. Note: Apparently this only works for public repos.
